# ValeriOS

Welcome to the ValeriOS repository, a simple operating system I developed for the Arduino Mega board as part of the "Operating Systems" course at Sapienza University of Rome, academic year 2022/2023.

## Features

- **Multi-Process Management**: Supports concurrent execution of multiple processes.
- **Preemptive Context Switching**: Leverages a physical timer and interrupts for efficient process scheduling.
- **Process Isolation**: Each process has its own dedicated stack.
- **System Calls**: Includes essential calls like `spawn`, `wait`, `sleep`, and `semaphore` operations for concurrency control.

## Background & Awards

ValeriOS started from my deep interest in how operating systems work, influenced by my studies in the "Operating Systems" course at Sapienza University of Rome. Wanting to go beyond what we learned in class, I decided to build ValeriOS for the Arduino Mega board. 

Typically, the course required students to focus on a single topic from the lectures for their final project. However, I chose to challenge myself by integrating multiple concepts into a fully functional operating system. 

Recognizing the breadth and depth of ValeriOS, which went well beyond the usual project scope, the **professor awarded it a score of 9, surpassing the maximum possible score of 8**, to acknowledge the comprehensive effort and dedication it represented.
